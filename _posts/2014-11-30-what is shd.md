Science Hack Day is a three-day event where anyone excited about making weird, silly or serious things with science comes together in the same physical space to see what they can prototype within 36 consecutive hours.

Designers, developers, artists, scientists and people from any background are welcome to attend â€“ **<em>no experience in science or hacking is necessary</em>, just an insatiable curiosity**. The event is organized by volunteers, and supported via sponsors. SHD India 2018 will be our 3rd annual event!

The mission of Science Hack Day is simply to get excited and make things with science! People organically form multidisciplinary teams over the course of a weekend: particle physicists team up with designers, marketers join forces with open source rocket scientists, writers collaborate with molecular biologists, and developers partner with school kids. By collaborating on focused tasks during this short period, small groups of hackers are capable of producing remarkable results.

        
Here&#8217;s a video from SHD San Fransisco that shows what the event is like:
